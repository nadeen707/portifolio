                        <p> The task of being a shadow teacher requires important values such as understanding each student in need and how they can be benefited. It also requires persistence and yet a delicate personality that the student would seek comfort with. As a shadow teacher, I visit students 4 times a week to make sure that they aren't struggling during that lesson. And if they were, I would sit and explain it to them. I'm usually designated in the mathematics section as it is one of my strong suits, as well as the English section. This lasted 2 years, and I hope to continue it. </p>

                        <p>  twice a week I would help the head of the English department with grading students' quizzes and homeworks, and put them into the grade book. I would organize all the works each student has done by putting them in a folder specifically for their grade. I did this for all 11 and 12th graders. And since the students' grades are confidential, only the teacher and I have access to it, meaning there needs to be a high level of trust for both the teacher and the students.</p>

                    <p>  During my time in Saudi Aramco schools, I got the chance to discover new activities. I showered myself with as many things to do as I could, This included sports. I started doing all kinds of sports presented to me. I was a part of the basketball, volleyball, soccer, and lacrosse teams. During this time, we would practice for 8 hrs a week so that we could be ready to play against different schools. I was a part of my volleyball team for 4 years.</p>

                    <p>  During the spiritual month of Ramadan each year, I lead a charity organization with an already existing charity group to help donate and distribute everything. I gather anyone willing to help and we assist in cooking and packaging the foods. After that, we pass out the food to anyone in need. This helps us on so many levels and not just the gratitude we should already feel.</p>

                    <p> One of the main extracurricular activities that I did was competitive choir. It was one of my favorites. We had lessons every day for 1 hour. We would host and travel to different cities and countries to sing professionally. One of the top places  I visited was KAUST university, where we sang during their open-day event.

I helped out whenever there was an event, and even when there wasn't. It was a learning experience for me, and I'm glad I did it. They taught me to work under pressure and become better at describing my emotions as I wrote. </p>

                <p>  I was an actress, living in the theater for 2 years. It was one of the best things I had done. I got to do silly things and not be judged for it. I met people that I loved, and characters that I adored. I played “into the woods” and “ music man”. And although I only had the main role for into the woods, I had the best time in both.
